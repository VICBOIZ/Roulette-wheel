# Roulette-wheel

This is a Roulette wheel game developed with Python languages. The project game I was created while learning with Nucamp Coding Bootcamp. Everything that I used in this project game is all from the bootcamp that I learned from. The
rule is: you want to choose any number from 0 to 36, Odds & Even or you can choose the color Red or B lack and you
can place multiple picks at one game play. If the winning number match your pick, then you win. Bets on red or black,
odd or even pay 1 for 1, a bet on a single number pays 35 to 1. I used tuples to store and separate odds, even, red, black
numbers. And the While loops for the picking, betting and check if you win or not, along with it I used some â€œ if
"functions to keep track on player coins/points, and put everything in a Class.
